# Brainstorm

Generate creative ideas and solutions for any topic, problem, or challenge.

## Input
- Describe your topic, problem, or goal
- Reference files with @filename for context
- Say "project context" to auto-scan current codebase

## Process
1. **Understand**: Clarify the challenge and constraints
2. **Diverge**: Generate diverse ideas without judgment
3. **Connect**: Find patterns and build on concepts
4. **Evaluate**: Assess feasibility and impact

## Output Format
### Quick Ideas (5-10 rapid-fire concepts)
- Bullet list of initial thoughts

### Developed Concepts (3-5 detailed ideas)
For each concept:
- **Idea**: Clear description
- **Why it works**: Key benefits
- **Implementation**: How to execute
- **Considerations**: Potential challenges

### Next Steps
- Most promising direction to explore
- Questions to investigate further
- Resources or research needed

## Constraints
- Consider technical feasibility
- Account for time/resource limitations
- Build on existing project context when available
- Focus on actionable ideas over abstract concepts

## Examples
- "Brainstorm ways to improve user onboarding"
- "Generate ideas for reducing API response times"
- "Creative solutions for team collaboration challenges"
